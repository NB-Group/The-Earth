This project is implemented very simply, using Python as the backend to automatically fetch real-time remote sensing satellite monitoring images from Chinese meteorological stations. The project is fully hosted on GitHub.

Here, you can feel the passage of time and admire the magnificent beauty of nature. In your leisure time, you can open my project in full screen, plunge into the profound and timeless river of history, traverse mountains and rivers, whether it's the lush greenery of daylight or the scattered starlight of the night. You can also see the magnificent mountains and rivers of our boundless homeland, to savor, to experience~
